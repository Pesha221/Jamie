### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate **backend developer** currently learning through the **ALX ProDev Backend Program**.  
My journey into software engineering began with a curiosity about how technology shapes the modern world — and that curiosity has evolved into a drive to **build, optimize, and innovate** with code.

I’m particularly inspired by how **digital transformation and automation** can solve real-world problems, and I’m committed to continuously learning and contributing to impactful tech projects.

- 💻 Exploring **networking fundamentals** through **Cisco Networking** concepts.  
- 🔍 Building and experimenting with small projects to apply new skills in real-world contexts.  
- 🤝 Seeking **entry-level opportunities** or **backend developer internships** where I can learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful tech solutions.
